            <h1>Bombay Cat</h1>

            <p>
                The Bombay cat is a short-haired breed of domestic cat. Bombays are glossy 
                solid black cats with a muscular build and have characteristic large bright 
                copper-golden eyes. A healthy Bombay has an average lifespan of 15 years, 
                and some have been known to live up to 20. They can have some nasal and 
                sinus problems, and gingivitis. Their food intake should be controlled to 
                avoid overfeeding. The personality of Bombay tends to be highly social, is marked 
                by strong attachment to families, and is typified by craving attention. As a breed, 
                these characteristics make them highly suitable for children. Bombay cats are happy and comfortable 
                being strictly indoor cats, and can comfortably live in a single room apartment, so 
                long as all their needs are met. They prefer quiet surroundings.

            <h1>Scottish Fold</h1>

            <p>
                The Scottish Fold is a distinctive breed of domestic cat characterized by a natural dominant 
                gene mutation associated with osteochondrodysplasia. This genetic anomaly affects cartilage 
                throughout the body, causing the ears to "fold", bending forward and down towards the front of the head. 
                While this trait contributes to the breed's unique appearance, often described as "owl-like", it also 
                causes health problems. Because of these health conditions, breeding Fold cats is prohibited in several 
                countries, and some major cat registries do not recognize the breed. The Scottish Fold is a sweet, charming breed. 
                She is an easy cat to live with and to care for. She is affectionate and is comfortable with all members 
                of her family. Her tail should be handled gently. Some of these cats are known to develop stiffness in the 
                tail that can cause pain if it is mishandled or accidentally handled in a rough manner

            <h1>Maine Coon</h1>

            <p>
                The Maine Coon is a large and social cat, commonly referred to as "the gentle giant." The Maine Coon 
                is predominantly known for its size and dense coat of fur which helps it survive in the harsh climate of 
                Maine. The Maine Coon is often cited as having "dog-like" characteristics. On average, males weigh from 
                18 to 22 lb, with females weighing from 12 to 15 lb. The height of adults can vary between 10 and 16 in 
                and they can reach a length of up to 38 In, including the tail, which can reach a length of 14 In and is 
                long, tapering, and heavily furred, almost resembling a raccoon's tail. Their full size is normally not 
                reached until they are three to five years old, while other cats take about one year. Because they have 
                no fur, Sphynx cats lose body heat more readily than coated cats, making them both warm to the touch and 
                prone to seeking out warm places

            <h1>Sphynx Cat</h1>

            <p>
                The Sphynx cat also known as the Canadian Sphynx, is a breed of cat known for its lack of fur. Hairlessness 
                in cats is a naturally occurring genetic mutation. Sphynxes are not necessarily hypoallergenic. Allergies 
                to cats are triggered by a protein called Fel d1, not cat hair itself.  Fel d1 is a protein primarily found 
                in cat saliva and sebaceous glands. Those with cat allergies may react to direct contact with Sphynx cats. 
                Even though reports exist that some people with allergies successfully tolerate Sphynx cats, they are fewer 
                than those who have allergic reactions.  Sphynx are known for their extroverted behavior. They display a high 
                level of energy, intelligence, curiosity and affection for their owners. They are one of the more dog-like 
                breeds of cats, frequently greeting their owners at the door and are friendly when meeting strangers. Sphynx 
                cats tend to be highly attached to their owners, often demanding large amounts of attention, and if said 
                attention is not given, can get into trouble. The mischievous cats love to cuddle for body warmth, due to their lack of fur.
                <bold>Due to lack of fur please research thoroughly about their care, things like outdoor sunlight and specific bathing needs to be done with routine.</bold>
