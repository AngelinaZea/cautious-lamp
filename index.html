                <h2>Should you own a cat? Better question, should I get a third cat?</h2>
                    <p class="site-intro">
                        This website is for those future and current cat lovers but <em>honestly mostly for me to 
                        decide what my third cat should be.</em> I have researched the benefits of owning a pet
                        and chose a total of four cats to start the cat breed page. I would also like to say 
                        that owning a pure breed cat can be great but looking into your local animal shelters 
                        can also provide you with an equally great cat. Though maybe all your planning can be thrown 
                        away because the universe cat distribution program can throw you a feline friend on a random day. 
                        That is how I got my two current cats, Tanuki and Kioki.
